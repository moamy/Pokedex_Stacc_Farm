# Pokedex for Stacc Farm!
This is a PokÃ©dex demo created for Stacc Farm! :) 

I made the tests using Playwright, and everything else through pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I also used a font from Google Fonts, I hope that is okay with you since they are free to use. 

## Run the project
The project (without tests) can be run by downloading the project from GitHub as a ZIP-file and extracting it. Open the extracted folder and then open its `index.html` file!

## Run the tests
Running the tests requires a setup in Docker. 

I'm unsure if this is the best way to go about it, but I figured it should work relatively smoothly.

To run the tests, you have to pull and run the image. Run the following commands in the Docker terminal:

```
docker pull moamy/pokedex:latest
```

```
docker run -p 5500:5500 moamy/pokedex:latest
```

> OBS! The tests *may* have to be run twice in Docker for all of them to succeed. This is due to one of them involving pictures, which seem to work differently in Docker.

Exit the image manually via the Docker GUI. 

## Further notes
If you want to inspect the code for tests then these can be found at `tests > pokedex.spec.ts`. 

I hope this is sufficient!

With regards, 
Moa
